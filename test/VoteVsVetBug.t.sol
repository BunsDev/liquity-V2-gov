        /**

        Vote vs Veto

        If you veto -> The vote is decreased
        If you veto past the votes, the vote is not decreased, as we cannot create a negative vote amount, it needs to be net of the two

        Same for removing a veto, you can bring back votes, but you cannot bring back votes that didnâ€™t exist

        So for this
        Total votes
        =
        Sum votes - vetos

        But more specifically it needs to be the clamped delta of the two
